# Chatbot - Russian-Ukrainian war

A chatbot which provides current casualty statistics on the Russian-Ukrainian war.

## Description

As part of a project for Semantic Technologies in the first master's semester of computer science at the HKA, a chatbot is to be implemented that provides current casualty figures for the Russian-Ukrainian war. This is done with [Rivescript](https://www.rivescript.com/), which is the basis of the chatbot.
The bot gets the data from Wikipedia and pays attention to the semantic phrasing of the user. Depending on the bias, pro-Ukrainian, pro-Russian or U.S. estimates are provided.
